This document summarizes my work concerning comorbidity in the UKB. It is composed by several parts:

* **Data Wrangling**: Get the data from the UKB, calculate disease occurence + pairs of disease occurence + comorbidity index, download heritabilities from Neale's Lab, load ICD10 classification.
* **UKB general description**: a general explorative analysis on the UKB, just to make sure I know what I am talking about
