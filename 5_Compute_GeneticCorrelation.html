<p>This document aims to recover as much data as possible concerning genetic correlation between traits in the UKB. Several source of information are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>the <a href="http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org">LDHub website</a> provides GC between many pairs of traits</li>
<li>the <a href="http://www.nealelab.is">Neale lab</a> provide GWAS summary statistics for 600+ diseases from the UKB. Using LDSC, I computed the GC between each trait. Result file is available <a href="https://github.com/holtzy/UKB-Comorbidity/blob/master/0_DATA/Genetic_Correlation_of_UKB_diseases.txt.gz">here</a>.</li>
</ul>

<hr />
<p>The LD Hub <a href="http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/lookup/">website</a> gives the genetic correlations (GC) between the pairs of many diseases. I downloaded the results for 221 traits (without 7 traits from ENIGMA). The website is <a href="http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/lookup/">here</a> and the link I clicked is <a href="http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/static/media/LD-Hub_genetic_correlation_221x221_no_ENIGMA.xlsx">that one</a>. This has been done the 19/10/2017.</p>
<p>The problem is that it is really hard to make the link between these traits and ICD10 classification codes.</p>

<hr />
<p>The <a href="http://www.nealelab.is">Neale lab</a> provide GWAS summary statistics for 600+ diseases from the UKB. Using LDSC, I computed the GC between each trait. Result file is available <a href="https://github.com/holtzy/UKB-Comorbidity/blob/master/0_DATA/Genetic_Correlation_of_UKB_diseases.txt.gz">here</a>. This part gives the code I use to compute these GC:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> GWAS Sumstat</h2>
<p>Summary statistics of GWAS on UKB are available for many traits. There are here:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>/afm01/Q0286/huanwei.wang/reference/UKB_neale/gwas_results</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It appears that GWAS summary statistics are available for several mental disorders: F10,F20,F23,F25,F30,F31,F32,F33,F41,F43,F45,F52,F60,F99.</p>

<p>I now have the genetic correlation computed for many diseases. Sometimes the heritability of a disease was to low to use it in GCs. Finally I have GCs info for <strong>391</strong> different diseases, and <strong>72398 pairs</strong> of diseases. Among them, 1141 (1.5760104 %) are significatively different from 0.</p>
